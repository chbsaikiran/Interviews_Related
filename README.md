The ego is not your enemy, it’s your teacher. The more you observe the teacher, the more you learn. If you try to destroy your ego, you’ll end up with more of it. Because the destroyer is also the ego. The only way out of this is awareness. As the ego becomes aware of itself, it ends the behaviours that cause it suffering.
